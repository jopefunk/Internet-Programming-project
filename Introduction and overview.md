1. Introduction and overview:
================================

1.1 Introduction:
---------------------

In this project, we are designing BlogType ™ content management system which will behave like a blog. This CMS will have the basic functionalities of a blog, which means authentication, posting, editing and deleting posts. Database is supposed to save datas and comments. As the visitor can leave a comment, the comment box has a filter, that prevents visitors to spam or troll the page by excluding meaningless comments and overflowing repetition of words or letters. The box doesn’t either allow a visitor to write executable code inside the box, but it changes the harmful tags to appropriate ones.
All of this is going to help the users to enjoy each others posts, and the environment stays “clean” from trolling and unnecessary disturbance. To make the site more interesting and versatile, also Youtube videos are embedded automatically and images are easy to include to the text. When needed, Google Maps can be used to show location. In addition to this, the users have a possibility to create their own themes, which includes changing font, background and font color.


1.2 Overview:
----------------
When logged in, the page redirects the user to his/her own profile with the previous posts. This CMS will basically allow only registered users to post new articles. When articles are posted, it will be displayed as the highest article on the page. Users who have not registered are able to view published articles but they are not able to post new ones. Comments are posted only by registered users and then are showed to public after that.
There is a page for admin or registered users to login for editing, publishing or deleting 


2. Specific requirements:
-----------------------------
This system should allow users to review their articles first before they are published
Database system to store users’ information : MySQL
A hosting that support PHP 5 or later.
Google Maps API for mapping
